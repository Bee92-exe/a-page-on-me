      <p>
          I still remember the shade you loved the most;<br>
          From a quiet corner, I watched the dress you wore.  <br>
          I still breath the faint fragnance of your hair, <br>
          Like spring that lingers softly in despair. <br><br>

          Your gentle eyes - two stars of calm, <br>
          Drew my soul with their fevered charm. <br>
          I keep the handkerchief once entwined, <br> 
          It's tender line recalls your mind. <br><br>

          Your lips - so soft, so shy, so fair; <br>
          Held a kiss I still find everywhere. <br> 
          The mirror forgets my face, not your trace; <br>
          I live in rooms still haunted by your grace. <br><br>

          The letters fade, the ink grows pale; <br>
          Yet memory sails where time can't sail. <br>
          The wind still carries your laughter ghost, <br>
          The moonlight bends to where you stood most. <br><br>

          The evening hums our broken tune, <br>
          The stars recall that vanished june. <br>
          I whisper your name into empty prayer, <br>
          And feel you breathing though you're not here. <br><br>

          I don't seek you to return, <br> 
          Nor ask the past again to burn. <br>
          I only wish the night could know, <br>
          How much I loved you, long ago.   <br><br>

          Now let me fade where echos sleep, <br>
          In dreams your silent memories keep.<br>
          For some love's end, but our became <br>
          A Ghost that whispers through your name.

      <h2>Empty Rooms</h2>
      <p>
        I learned silence from empty rooms,<br>
        where echoes knew my name better than people.<br><br>

        Love arrived quietly,<br>
        like dust on unused furniture,<br>
        and left the same way.

      <h2>The Ghost I Married</h2>
      <p>
        I still write to you, <br>
        as if words could reach wherever you went. <br>
        Not Heaven, <br>
        not another world— <br>
        just… somewhere that I can no longer enter, <br>
        though I once lived in the warmth of your eyes. <br><br>

        You weren’t just a girl. <br>
        You were a season. <br>
        A whole sky I learned to breathe under, <br>
        a silence I once wore like a second skin. <br><br>

        The day you left, <br>
        the world didn’t end. <br>
        It slowed. <br>
        It blurred. <br>
        Like someone took the sun and dimmed it, <br>
        but left just enough light to make me remember <br>
        what I lost. <br><br>

        I still see you.  <br>
        in the corners of quiet afternoons, <br>
        in the threads of your old voice notes <br>
        I no longer play <br>
        but never delete. <br>
        You are not gone. <br>
        You are diffused— <br>
        into everything that hurts quietly now. <br><br>

        Sometimes I look at my reflection <br>
        and wonder when my eyes stopped belonging to me. <br>
        When did they start searching for you? <br>
        They still look for you. <br>
        Still wait for you to walk back into frame, <br>
        like a movie that never ends, <br>
        just pauses forever. <br><br>

        And if someone asks me why I still carry you, <br>
        I tell them this, <br>
        Because some loves <br>
        do not die, <br>
        they become ghosts— <br>
        and I married mine. <br><br>

        I still set a place for you <br>
        in my thoughts. <br>
        I still speak your name <br>
        into poems I never share. <br>
        I still live with the absence of your presence <br>
        like a song that plays only in dreams. <br><br>

        I don’t ask you to come back. <br>
        I don’t beg the past. <br>
        I just… remember. <br>
        And remembering you feels holy, <br>
        even if it hurts. <br><br>

        You were the only thing that ever made the pain feel <br>
        like it had purpose. <br><br>

        So no, <br>
        I don’t want to forget. <br>
        I want to live like a shrine <br>
        to the love that never had an ending. <br>
        I want to be the boy <br>
        who once loved a girl <br>
        so much, <br>
        he made time kneel <br>
        just to remember her.

      <h2>The Daylight Where You Linger</h2>
      <p>
        I saw your face today, <br>
        not in a dream, <br>
        but in the quiet curve of morning light <br>
        spilling across the floor— <br>
        the kind of light that doesn't ask for attention, <br>
        just quietly stays. <br><br>

        You looked the same. <br>
        Hair resting on your shoulder like it always did, <br>
        eyes full of stories you never told me <br>
        but I somehow understood anyway. <br><br>

        You didn’t speak, <br>
        and neither did I. <br>
        We never needed words, remember? <br><br>

        I wanted to reach for you— <br>
        not to hold, <br>
        not to bring you back, <br>
        but just to feel <br>
        what it was like to stand in your presence again <br>
        without the ache. <br><br>

        You were once my entire sky. <br>
        Now you’re the soft ache in the wind, <br>
        the familiar sting behind closed eyes, <br>
        the silence after a favorite song ends. <br><br>

        And still, <br>
        I wouldn’t trade it— <br>
        even this pain. <br>
        Even the nights it tears me apart. <br><br>

        Because loving you,   <br>
        even in your absence, <br>
        taught me how deep a heart can feel. <br>
        How one smile can live forever <br>
        inside someone who never got to say goodbye. <br><br>

        So I write this, <br>
        not to bring you back, <br>
        but to say: <br>
        You were real. <br>
        You mattered. <br>
        And you still live here— <br>
        in the quiet places of me <br>
        that no one else will ever reach.

      <h2>Philosophy of Waiting</h2>
      <p>
        I wait, not for people,<br>
        but for meanings to arrive.<br><br>

        Some never do.<br>
        Some arrive too late,<br>
        asking why I’m no longer the same.

      <h2>A Letter I Never Sent</h2>
      <p>
        Hey,
        I don’t know where to begin, <br>
        Maybe from that moment you smiled and unknowingly rewrote my world. <br>
        You were poetry before I even knew how to read feelings. <br>
        You walked in - <br>
        not with fireworks, but with silence that felt like home. <br>
        Back then, <br>
        everything felt light. <br>
        The sky had your name in its shade of blue. <br>
        And my heart; <br>
        God, it wasn’t just beating, it was singing. <br>
        We never needed to say it out loud, did we? <br>
        It was in the pauses. <br>
        In the way I waited for your voice <br>
        like the moon waits for the tide. <br>
        But I never told you.
        how sacred your presence was. <br>
        How you made me feel seen <br>
        as if someone finally knew the language of my silence. <br>
        And maybe that’s where I failed. <br>
        I loved you in silence, <br>
        when I should’ve screamed it into the wind. <br>
        Then came the slow fading. <br>
        No fight. No goodbye. Just… distance. <br>
        Like watching a star burn out in the sky <br>
        but pretending the night is still the same. <br>
        I still don’t know what we were, <br>
        but I know what I was—  <br>
        in love. <br><br>
        Now?  <br>
        Now I live with ghosts. <br>
        You're everywhere and nowhere. <br>
        In every poem I can't finish. <br>
        In every song I skip because it sounds too much like your name. <br>
        And sometimes, when I laugh, <br>
        I wonder if it would’ve sounded better with you beside me. <br>
        And still the truth remains, <br>
        not spoken, but aching in verse— <br>
        I never stopped carrying you. <br>
        You live in the softest parts of me, <br>
        in the tears I hide, <br>
        in the dreams I never speak of. <br>
        I don't want to move on. <br>
        Not because I can't— <br>
        but because this love, <br>
        even in its ache, <br>
        is mine. <br>
        It made me who I am. <br>
        And letting it go would mean letting go of a piece of my soul. <br>
        So wherever you are.<br>
        if you ever wonder— <br>
        Yes, someone once loved you like the sky loves stars, <br>
        even if he never said it in time. <br>
        And he still does. <br>
        Quietly. <br>
        Always.

      <h2>Love, in Lowercase</h2>
      <p>
        Love doesn’t scream here.<br>
        It whispers, fails, returns,<br>
        and learns how to stay quiet.

      <h2>What they DID!</h2>
      <p>
        I was soft once. <br>
        Then the world came, <br>
        with its sharp hands <br>
        and its crooked gods <br>
        and tore pages out of me <br>
        until I forgot how the story ends.
